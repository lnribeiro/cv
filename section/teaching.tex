{\sl Teacher Assistant} 

I have experience as a teacher assistant in the Telecommunications Engineering undergraduate course at Universidade Federal do Cear\'a, Fortaleza, in the following lectures:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[--] Digital signal processing (2018.1, 2019.1);

\end{itemize}

{\sl Mentoring}

Supervision of undergraduate students at Universidade Federal do Cear\'a within the scientific initiation program. The mentoring consisted of guiding the students through advanced signal processing topics, such as beamforming (Isac Lira, Clarissa Herculano in 2015) and multilinear algebra (Thiago Barbosa, 2018).
